## About <!-- edit this to include a link to a relevant Embedded Systems/Robotics project in the future --> 
Hi! I'm Kevin Koffroth, hailing proudly from Savannah, Georgia. I attend the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/), where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in [Computer Systems Engineering](http://www.engr.uga.edu/bs-computer-systems-engineering). I love to work on [robotics](https://github.com/Jyumpp/ASABE-2020) and [embedded systems](https://github.com/ktkoffroth/ubody-firmware-atmega2560) projects, and I hope to get more of those opportunities in the future!
